            <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for

                <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We

                    self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that
                    each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future
                    of music culture.

                    magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
                    richly
                    diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree

                    each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

                    development and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and
